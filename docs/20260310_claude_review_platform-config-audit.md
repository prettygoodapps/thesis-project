## Issues Found

### CRITICAL

**C1 — Duplicate H1 heading in both files**
Both files contain their H1 title repeated on lines 1 and 5, creating malformed structure. This happens because the files were merged without removing the original heading.

- `CLAUDE.md` lines 1 and 5: `# CLAUDE.md — Thesis Project` appears twice
- `GEMINI.md` lines 1 and 3: `# GEMINI.md - Thesis Project Context` appears twice

### MAJOR

**M1 — Corrupt model identifier list (both files)**
The model list in the File Naming summary has a copy-paste error: the second identifier is a duplicate of the platform's own name instead of listing other models.

- `CLAUDE.md` line 23: `` `claude`, `claude`, `perplexity`... `` — second `claude` should be `gemini`
- `GEMINI.md` line 30: `` `gemini`, `gemini`, `perplexity`... `` — second `gemini` should be `claude`

This means each AI model only sees its own name listed twice and may not know to use the other identifiers correctly.

**M2 — Duplicate commit convention in CLAUDE.md**
The commit convention is stated twice in CLAUDE.md:
- Line 58-59: `## Commit Convention` section
- Line 62: also stated within `## Technical Conventions`

One of these should be removed.

**M3 — Inconsistent section order**
The section sequence differs between files, which makes maintaining them harder and can cause one AI to receive context in a different order than another.

| Order | CLAUDE.md | GEMINI.md |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project Overview | Project Overview |
| 2 | AI Document Conventions | Ecosystem Context |
| 3 | Commit Convention | Directory Structure |
| 4 | Technical Conventions | AI Document Conventions |
| 5 | Usage | Technical Conventions |
| 6 | — | Usage |
| 7 | — | Commit Convention (appended at end) |

### MINOR

**m1 — Missing blank lines between sections**
Several section headings follow directly from the previous section's last line without a blank line separator. This is a Markdown formatting issue that renders correctly but reduces source readability.

Affected locations:
- `CLAUDE.md`: before `## AI Document Conventions` (line 13), before `## Commit Convention` (line 58)
- `GEMINI.md`: before `## Technical Conventions` (line 65), before `## Usage` (line 69)

**m2 — CLAUDE.md missing Ecosystem/Vault context**
`GEMINI.md` has `Ecosystem Context` and `Directory Structure` sections that orient Gemini to the workspace layout. `CLAUDE.md` references the vault briefly (`as-link thesis-project docs`) but lacks equivalent structured context. This is partially intentional (Claude Code has workstation context from the global CLAUDE.md) but worth noting.

**m3 — Heading style inconsistency**
`CLAUDE.md` uses `# CLAUDE.md — Thesis Project` (em-dash) while `GEMINI.md` uses `# GEMINI.md - Thesis Project Context` (hyphen, different subtitle). Minor but reduces visual consistency when viewed side by side.

## Recommended Change Set

Listed in priority order. All changes are minimal — no content is being rewritten.

### Fix C1 — Remove duplicate H1 in both files
Delete the second occurrence of the H1 heading (lines 5-7 in CLAUDE.md, lines 3 in GEMINI.md).

### Fix M1 — Correct model identifier lists
- `CLAUDE.md` line 23: change `` `claude`, `claude` `` → `` `claude`, `gemini` ``
- `GEMINI.md` line 30: change `` `gemini`, `gemini` `` → `` `gemini`, `claude` ``

### Fix M2 — Remove duplicate commit convention from CLAUDE.md
Remove the standalone `## Commit Convention` section (lines 58-59). The convention is already captured in `## Technical Conventions`.

### Fix M3 — Align section order
Adopt a consistent section sequence for both files. Recommended order (platform-specific sections are marked with *):

1. Project Overview
2. Ecosystem Context * *(Gemini only / optional for Claude)*
3. Directory Structure * *(Gemini only / optional for Claude)*
4. AI Document Conventions
5. Technical Conventions *(includes commit convention — no separate section needed)*
6. Usage

### Fix m1 — Add missing blank lines
Add blank line before each `##` section heading that currently runs directly from prior content.
